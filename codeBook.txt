                    IT'S ALWAYS SUNNY IN PHILADELPHIA DATASET CODEBOOK

Good Codebooks should include:
* Description of the study: who did it, why they did it, how they did it.
* Sampling information: what was the population studied, how was the sample drawn, what was the response rate.
* Technical information about the files themselves: number of observations, record length, number of records per observation, etc.
* Structure of the data within the file: hierarchical, multiple cards, etc.
* Details about the data: columns in which specific variables can be found, whether they are character or numeric, and if numeric, what format.
* Text of the questions and responses: some even have how many people responded a particular way.

                            DESCRIPTION OF THE STUDY

SUMMARY: To collect data on the Television show It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia in order to create an informative infographic or two.  And for science!

Data collected by Erich Wellinger and Kevin Winn in our free-time, oftentimes aided by the consumption of a beer or several.  Due to the frequent inebriation of those collecting the data, please contact ewellinger@icloud.com with any corrections which need to be made.

General info concerning the show was scraped using the OMDB API (www.omdbapi.com) and is contained in the generalInfo.csv file

Activity and Character info will be recorded on a per episode basis and stored in activityInfo.csv and characterInfo.csv, respectively (tentatively).

Allegiance info will be recorded dynamically as an episode progresses with an associated timestamp.  The state of the gang allegiances will be recorded using boolean values, which will in turn be used to create hash-maps when analysis is done (tenatively).
        - Still working on how best to go about recording this

GANG ALLEGIANCE INFO
------------------------
* Allegiance info is proving exceedingly difficult to record.  Oftentimes allegiances will form around a certain stance (e.g. whether or not to allow underage kids in the bar) but will then evolve over the course of an episode to some other being centered on some other issue (e.g. over whether to go to the high school prom)
