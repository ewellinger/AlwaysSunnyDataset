# AlwaysSunnyDataset
Dataset of It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia

                            DESCRIPTION OF THE STUDY

SUMMARY: To collect data on the Television show It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia in order to create an informative infographic or two.  And for science!

Data collected by Erich Wellinger and Kevin Winn in our free-time, oftentimes aided by the consumption of a beer or several.

General info concerning the show was scraped using the OMDB API (www.omdbapi.com) and is contained in the generalInfo.csv file.

Activity and Character info will be recorded on a per episode basis and stored in activityInfo.csv and characterInfo.csv, respectively (tentatively).

Allegiance info will be recorded dynamically as an episode progresses with an associated timestamp.  The state of the gang allegiances will be recorded using boolean values, which will in turn be used to create hash-maps when analysis is done (tenatively).
        - Still working on how best to go about recording this (this may be scrapped at some point)
