                IT'S ALWAYS SUNNY IN PHILADELPHIA

* Need to come up with ideas for what variables we'll be tracking and the data types (i.e. bool, bin, int, string)


Variables:
    * SingleEpisode
        - Tell whether it's part of a double episode
    * Location?
    * Original air date
    * Directed By
    * Written By

Could maybe keep track of if certain characters appear in the episode.  These could probably be bool values
    * Obviously Dennis, Charlie, Mac, Dee, and Frank
    *  (from under the bridge), Frank's brother, Lil' Kev,  Bruce Mathis, other Bruce, Dee/Dennis' Mom (Barbara Reynolds), Pop-Pop, Artemis, Gail the Snail, , Z (Dennis from under the bridge), , , Rex, Principal MacIntyre, Brad Fisher, Hwang, Schmitty, Ingrid 'Fatty Magoo' Nelson, Da' Maniac

Could also keep track of activities  //for both 'Drugs' and 'Drinking' we should record what character consumed them, and if possible, an approximation of the amount consumed.
    * Drugs
        - Huffing Glue
        - Smoking Crack
        - Steroids
        - Weed
        - Other (riterall, Oxy, sedative brownie, Cocaine etc.)
    * Drinking
        - Beer
        - Liquor
        - Wine
        - Grain Alcohol (probably just part of liquor)
    * Scamming people
    * D.E.N.N.I.S. system
    * Getting drunk (explicitly seeing them getting drunk)
        - Maybe bool, and then keep track of the number of specific kinds of drinks?
    * Frank's vietnamese connections
    * Charlie getting shut down by the waitress  // perhaps implement something simmilar to our 'team pairning' set up for this?
    * Waitress getting shut down by Dennis
    * Night crawlers
    * The gang stabbing each other in the back
    * Gang threatens someone
    * Dee referenced as a bird
        - int
    * Dee's car getting ruined
    * Mac's karate skills (sound effects?)
    * Ocular pat down
    * T-Shirts (Kentucky shirts)
        - Maybe breakdown by Charlie and Mac
    * Ratio of liquor to beer (or something like that) // could be handled with 'drinking/drugs' suggestion stated above'
    * Number of God-damnnits
    * Charlie's illiteracy  // TODO: quantify Charlie's illiteracy
    * Number of times the gang threatens someone // int threat should be associated with who made it / who was threatened. Possibly recorded as Tuple?
        - int
    * Uncle Jack referencing hands
    * Bird law / Charlie being a lawyer
    * Does Frank bail the gang out?
        - Bool
    * Reference to Philadelphia sports team
        - Eagles, Flyers, and Phillies
    * Green Man
    * Guns
    * Eating cat food
    * Mention Dennis' sex tapes
    * Operation Badass
    * Gang sings a capella
    * Black face?
    * Dee calls someone a turkey
    * The gang makes it about patriotism
    * Mention of Dayman / Nightman
    * Breakdown of the allegiances within the gang
    * Dennis being vain
    * Presence of Children // with approximate age? e.g. children vs high school kids
