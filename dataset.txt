                IT'S ALWAYS SUNNY IN PHILADELPHIA

* Need to come up with ideas for what variables we'll be tracking and the data types (i.e. bool, bin, int, string)


    * Scamming people

    * Frank's vietnamese connections
    * Night crawlers
    * The gang stabbing each other in the back
    * Gang threatens someone

    * Dee's car getting ruined
    * Mac's karate skills (sound effects?)
    * Ocular pat down
    * T-Shirts (Kentucky shirts)
        - Maybe breakdown by Charlie and Mac
    * Number of God-damnnits
    * Charlie's illiteracy  // TODO: quantify Charlie's illiteracy
    * Number of times the gang threatens someone // int threat should be associated with who made it / who was threatened. Possibly recorded as Tuple?
        - int
    * Uncle Jack referencing hands
    * Bird law / Charlie being a lawyer
    * Reference to Philadelphia sports team
        - Eagles, Flyers, and Phillies
    * Guns
    * Mention Dennis' sex tapes
    * Operation Badass
    * Gang sings a capella
    * Black face?
    * Dee calls someone a turkey
    * Mention of Dayman / Nightman
    * Breakdown of the allegiances within the gang

    * Green Man (Might want to put this into character info)
        - Is green man a character or simply an activity for Charlie?
        - Which came first; the chicken or the egg?
