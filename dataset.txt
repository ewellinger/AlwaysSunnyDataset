                IT'S ALWAYS SUNNY IN PHILADELPHIA

* Need to come up with ideas for what variables we'll be tracking and the data types (i.e. bool, bin, int, string)


    * T-Shirts (Kentucky shirts)
        - Maybe breakdown by Charlie and Mac
    * Charlie's illiteracy  // TODO: quantify Charlie's illiteracy
    * Number of times the gang threatens someone // int threat should be associated with who made it / who was threatened. Possibly recorded as Tuple?
        - int
    * Breakdown of the allegiances within the gang

    * Dee wanting to become an actor
    * Maybe something to do with Dennis' car?
