                IT'S ALWAYS SUNNY IN PHILADELPHIA

* Need to come up with ideas for what variables we'll be tracking and the data types (i.e. bool, bin, int, string)


Variables:
    * SingleEpisode
        - Tell whether it's part of a double episode
    * Location?
    * Original air date
    * Directed By
    * Written By

Could maybe keep track of if certain characters appear in the episode.  These could probably be bool values
    * Obviously Dennis, Charlie, Mac, Dee, and Frank
    *  (from under the bridge), Frank's brother, Lil' Kev,  Bruce Mathis, other Bruce, Dee/Dennis' Mom (Barbara Reynolds), Pop-Pop, Artemis, Gail the Snail, , Z (Dennis from under the bridge), , , Rex, Principal MacIntyre, Brad Fisher, Hwang, Schmitty, Ingrid 'Fatty Magoo' Nelson, Da' Maniac

    * D.E.N.N.I.S. system
